# Trivy Dashboard (Flask)

A simple Flask web application for uploading, storing, and visualizing Trivy vulnerability scan reports.

## Features
- Upload Trivy JSON reports via web interface
- View history of uploaded reports
- Visualize vulnerability counts by severity (bar chart)
- Simple, clean dashboard UI

## Project Structure
```
app.py                # Main Flask application
static/
  style.css           # CSS for dashboard styling
templates/
  dashboard.html      # Main dashboard HTML template
uploads/              # Directory for uploaded Trivy reports
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```
pip install flask
```

### 2. Run the application
```
python app.py
```

### 3. Open in your browser
Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to access the dashboard.

## Running on Linux with a Virtual Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the dashboard from your browser:
   - On the same machine: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - On your local network: http://<your-linux-ip>:5000/

To find your Linux machine's IP address, run:
```bash
hostname -I
```

## Running Docker Container and Accessing the App

1. **Run the Docker container with a volume mount**
   Replace `C:\Users\uday\Desktop\trivy` with your actual code directory if different.
   ```powershell
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v C:\Users\uday\Desktop\trivy:/app trivy-dashboard:latest
   ```
   - `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
   - `-p 5000:5000` maps port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container.
   - `-v ...:/app` mounts your code folder into the container (so uploads and code changes are reflected).

2. **Find your computerâ€™s IP address**
   In PowerShell, run:
   ```powershell
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for the IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

3. **Access the app from another device on your network**
   Open a browser and go to:
   ```
   http://<your-ip>:5000/
   ```
   (Replace `<your-ip>` with your actual IP address.)

Your Flask dashboard should now be accessible from any device on the same network!

## Exporting and Importing the Docker Image

To export the Docker image as a tar file (from the machine where you built it):
```powershell
docker save trivy-dashboard:latest -o trivy-dashboard.tar
```

To import the Docker image on another machine (after copying/extracting the tar file):
```powershell
docker load -i trivy-dashboard.tar
```

You can then run the container as described above.

## Usage
- Use the upload form to add Trivy JSON reports.
- Uploaded reports are listed with their upload time.
- The dashboard displays a bar chart summarizing vulnerabilities by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNKNOWN).

## Notes
- Only JSON files are accepted for upload.
- Uploaded reports are stored in the `uploads/` directory.
- The dashboard uses Chart.js (via CDN) for data visualization.

## Customization
- You can extend the dashboard to show more detailed trends, per-report details, or additional charts as needed.
